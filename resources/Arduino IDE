If you must use the Arduino IDE, here's what to do. 

Make sure you have the ESP8266 extensions installed in the IDE

Create a directory called "GPSTimeServer" 
Copy the src/main.cpp file there and rename it "GPSTimeServer.ino"
Copy the includes/definitions.h file there. Don't change the name
Use the IDE's library manager to search for and add the following libraries:

Timelib  Michael Margolis  v1.6.1
RTC      Makuna   v2.3.5  (must be this version)
TinyGPS  Mikal Hart  v13.0.0
U8g2     Oliver  v2.33.15

Set the board to NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)
Set the COM port
Compile and upload (hopefully!)
