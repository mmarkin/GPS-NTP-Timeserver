If you must use the Arduino IDE, here's what to do. I have not tried this but it should work.

Create a directory called "GPSTimeServer" 
Copy the src/main.cpp file there and rename it "GPSTimeServer.ino
Copy the includes/definitions.h file there. Don't change the name
Use the IDE's library manager to search for and add the following libraries

Timelib  Michael Margolis 
RTC      Makuna
TinyGPS  Mikal Hart 
U8g2     Oliver

Make sure you have the ESP8266 extensions installed in the IDE
Set the board to NodeMCU v
