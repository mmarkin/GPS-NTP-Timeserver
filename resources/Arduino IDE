If you must use the Arduino IDE, here's what to do.

Create a directory called "GPSTimeServer" 
Copy the src/main.cpp file there and rename it "GPSTimeServer.ino
Copy the includes/definitions.h file there. Its name does not have to be changed
Use the IDE's library manager to search for and add the following libraries


Make sure you have the ESP8266 extensions installed in the IDE
